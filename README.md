# Water-Quality_Analysis
This project develops a machine learning model to predict whether water is potable (safe for human consumption) based on various water quality parameters. The model analyzes features such as pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity.
